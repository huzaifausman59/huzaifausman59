# 👋 Hi, I'm Huzi

I'm a 5th semester Computer Science student at FAST, focused on building robust, scalable, and secure backend systems. I specialize in developing RESTful APIs, managing complex data relationships, and designing backend architectures that support real-world, full-stack applications.

## 🛠️ Core Skills

- **Languages**: JavaScript (Node.js), SQL, C++
- **Backend Development**:
  - REST APIs with **Express.js**
  - **Authentication systems** – OTP, JWT, refresh tokens, blacklisting
  - **Database design** – Complex entity relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many) using MySQL with migrations and seeders
  - Modular backend architecture (MVC pattern, service/controller structure)
  - Data validation with Joi
  - **Scheduling** with cron jobs
  - **Real-time features** via WebSocket

- **Tools & Utilities**: Git, Postman, MySQL Workbench, VS Code

## 🔐 Projects (Private Repositories)

### 📓 Notes App – Full-Stack Notes Platform

A backend-driven platform with:

- Secure authentication (login, refresh token, OTP-based password reset)
- Public/private notes, likes system, follower/following logic
- Real-time messaging using WebSocket
- Clean modular architecture (routes/controllers/services/middleware)
- Basic UI using Next.js + shadcn/ui to test and understand full-stack behavior

> Built to deeply understand scalable backend architecture and API security.

### 🧑‍💼 Dynamic Portfolio CMS

A backend-powered, admin-controlled portfolio management system. Frontend is simple, but the backend enables:

- Complete portfolio customization via admin routes
- Control over content: blogs, services, technologies, tools, team members, and more
- Complex database relationships (one-to-many & many-to-many with pivot tables)
- Scalable API structure supporting dynamic frontend rendering
- Role-based access logic (WIP)

> Built to explore how powerful backends can drive flexible, UI-independent systems like CMS platforms.
